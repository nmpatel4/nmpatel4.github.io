      <p>During the NFL's first six seasons the Bears had an amazing 34 shutout wins.</p>
      <p>The Bears trademark "C' logo was first displayed on their helmets in 1962. It was redesigned in 1974 by adding the teams primary colors to the existing logo. That redesign happened exactly 40 years ago. The quirky part of this one is the Bears logo is the exact same design used by the Chicago Cardinals from 1920 to 1947. The Cardinals were defunct so the Bears took their logo.</p>
      <p>In the 1940 NFL Championship game the Bears beat the Washington Redskins 73-0. Most Bears fans know of this game and its place in the league's lore. What most of them don't realize is that the game was halted in the fourth quarter so that referees could ask the Bears to try for two extra points instead of kicking for one as they were down to their last football. Coach George Halas was only too happy to comply.</p>

      <p>Matt Forte has been with the Bears his whole career, but is prepared to move on this offseason if they don’t offer him a contract, writes Chris Wesseling of NFL.com. “There’s nothing I can do, really, except play football,” Forte said. “The decision on whether I stay or whether I go is not really up to me. It’s whether I get offered a contract extension, which I haven’t been offered one and doesn’t really look like it. If not, I go into free agency. So I’m pretty much satisfied with either way it goes.”</p>
      <p>“There isn’t any rift or tension [between Bennett and the Bears,” agent Kennard McGuire tells Ian Rapoport of NFL.com (Twitter link). “Whoever is making these remarks should stand up to them.”</p>
