      <p>With Michael Jordan playing and Phil Jackson coaching, the Bulls won 6 championships in 8 years, with two three-peats (1991-1993 and 1995-1998)</p>
      <p>During the 1995-96 season with Jordan, the Bulls won 72 games (out of 82) – setting an NBA record that still hasn’t been broken</p>
      <p>Jordan retired twice in his career – first in 1993, but returned in 1995, and for good in 1998.</p>
      <p>In 1992, both the Bulls and the Blackhawks were playing in the Finals at the same time (NBA Finals for the Bulls and the Stanley Cup for the Blackhawks).  Both teams would lose in the Finals.</p>

      <p>You have the player option in your contract coming up this summer. Obviously a lot can happen from now until then, but would you like to stay in Chicago? Gasol: Yes, of course. But when the time comes we’ll evaluate it. I’ll see how the season went. Where are the team’s interests, where are my interests, what options do I have? But most important is for me and the team to focus on what we have this season to make the best out of it and give ourselves a chance to win the title. 13 hours ago – via ESPN.com</p>
      <p>After meeting with specialists in Los Angeles, the Chicago Bulls’ Mike Dunleavy is expected to need four-to-six weeks of additional rehabilitation on his back before he can be cleared to return for on-court work, league sources told Yahoo Sports. 16 hours ago – via Yahoo! Sports</p>
      <p>KC Johnson: Butler on his heel: “I don’t think anybody cares that I’m injured. I gotta play. Hopefully, it doesn’t get worse. It’s been nagging.” 4 days ago – via Twitter KCJHoop</p>
